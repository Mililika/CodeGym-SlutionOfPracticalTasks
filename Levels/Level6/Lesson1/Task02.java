/*
    TASK:
        Here is a bad example of using methods:

        The methods split up a couplet.
        It's not worth it to wrap a single line of code in a separate method.
        Rewrite the code so that all text is displayed in the main method, and the rest of the methods are removed.
        The execution of the program should not change.
