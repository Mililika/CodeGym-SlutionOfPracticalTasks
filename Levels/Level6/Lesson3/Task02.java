    TASK:
        Let's implement a calculator that will compute the powers of numbers.

        To do this, create a cube() method. It must take a long integer value as an argument.
        The method should raise the passed value to the third power and return it as the method's result.
        The numbers you have to work with may be large. Accordingly, the cube() method must return a long.
