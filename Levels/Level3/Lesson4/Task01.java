    TASK:
        Let's write a program that will calculate the possibility of the existence of a triangle based on the lengths
        of sides.
        To do this, you need to:
        Enter three numbers from the keyboard â€” the lengths of the sides of the assumed triangle.
        Use the lengths of the sides to determine whether a triangle is possible.
        Depending on the result, display "It's a triangle" or "It's not a triangle".
        To make this determination, you need to compare each side with the sum of the other two sides.
        That is, you will need to perform three comparisons:

        If each comparison indicates that the side is less than the sum of the other two sides, then a triangle
        with these sides does exist.
        If even one comparison indicates that the side is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two sides, then a
        triangle with these sides does not exist.
